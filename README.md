# Dataset Cleaning & Standardization Engine (Python)

This project implements an automated engine for cleaning and standardizing datasets.  
The system automatically detects schema patterns and data types (dates, numeric fields, strings), normalizes formats, standardizes column headers, cleans inconsistent values, identifies outliers and duplicates, and produces a structured, ready-to-use dataset in seconds.

Every transformation is designed to be **safe, traceable, and configurable**, making the tool reusable across different datasets without requiring manual intervention.
